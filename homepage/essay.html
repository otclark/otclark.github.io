  <h1 style="color:white;">My essay</h1>
    <p style="color:white;">Walking down the street, you can tell that this park is not like others in the city; it radiates its own energy, its own life. You can hear the roars from the streets afar. That was my first experience with Rucker Park. I remember early in my childhood, I had always wanted to visit Rucker Park. It is not like any other place in New York, where you can walk in and do as you please. Rucker Park has its own community, and it has its own family. My first time hearing about Rucker, the park was featured on an And 1 Mixtape that my Dad owned. Ever since I was a baby, my only dream was to play basketball; growing up in Washington Heights, I thought Rucker was my way to the big leagues. Everyone in my neighborhood constantly spoke about the basketball tournaments at Rucker, how Kobe would be at Rucker, and how all these NBA and streetball stars were always there. Rucker Park is located in Harlem, very close to where I grew up. The first time my Dad took me to the park to watch the games, I was ecstatic, and that feeling still has not gone away. I got to experience the park's energy for the first time that night and understand its hype. I got my first taste of being a part of a community that would accept me. Rucker is crowned as the streetball capital of New York City. A place coveted with multitudes of awards and accomplishments. Fast forward ten years, and I still go to Rucker regularly. Over the summer, I was able to play in the Rucker Park tournament myself; I was able to be myself with my team. We were able to have fun and experience what everyone who plays basketball in New York wishes they could experience. It is a special place to people all around the city who feel like they belong in the community; it has become like a second home to me and many others. </p>
    <p style="color:white;">Rucker Park is in New York to provide hoopers freedom to be themselves. It used to be a regular park connected to a school, but soon enough, And1 streetball took over in the early 2000s, and Rucker as a whole blew up. Everyone wanted to be there, and the place was packed every day. Rucker has changed with the times and stays up to date on construction and remodeling. It has been featured in recent movies like Uncle Drew and a Netflix documentary on And1. The memories I have from Rucker cause it to be as important to me as it is now. Seeing my icons like Kobe Bryant and other NBA Players play in their tournaments and streetball legends like The Professor. I always wanted to be like them when I grew up, and now I am 15 and have the opportunity to play my AAU games at the same park where legends have stepped foot on the same ground as me. The park has the effect of happiness and togetherness with people. People from all over the neighborhood gather at Rucker to watch people play. Everyone knows each other from their neighborhood, and they get to go out and watch us play even though they are not playing. They can look back on the old days when they used to play, and now they can relive their experiences. </p>
    <p style="color:white;">People come from around the city to join the Rucker family. The stadium seats are always packed while they watch us play and cheer for us. Rucker park is a staple in New York City; everyone who plays basketball knows about Rucker and the experiences and opportunities it creates for those around the city. There is nothing like Rucker Park. No place in New York has as much history. Rucker is beloved by many from all walks of life. I have seen Wall Street businessmen sitting next to homeless people watching the games at Rucker Park. Because that is what it is. The area has stayed the same, but the community has evolved. Being able to watch and be watched while playing in the tournaments is something that I will never forget. Rucker Park symbolizes family and friendship. It symbolizes people that work together and treat each other with respect. It symbolizes a family that always works hard to get what they have. Not everything in life is handed to you. Rucker Park is different from the rest of New York. The community of Rucker Park has evolved since the And1 streetball days. The truth is that Rucker is not just a regular park but a family. </p>
